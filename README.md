# MS-FindingThePath

Application can be found on https://findingpath.herokuapp.com/

### Explaination of the Code:

* The code finds the shortest path in a grid using the Breadth First Search algorithm. 
* Start node is denoted by green color and End node by red color.
* One can add obstacles by clicking on the nodes of the grid. The obstacles are denoted by grey color.
* Start and End node can be changed by options in the menu. 
* There is an option to use diagonal movements while finding the path. 
* Another node can be added by using option in the menu bar. The path then would be shortest path from start to new point and then new to end point. 
* The blue region after running the BFS algorithm shows the nodes that were visited.
